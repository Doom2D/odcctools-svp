Note: This fork is not fully updated to newer code and may have bugs. But this is enough to me to make Mac OS X PowerPC builds of http://repo.or.cz/d2df-sdl.git and its C/C++ dependencies using Apple GCC 4.2.1 as cross-compiler.

Known problems:
- 32-bit only
- ld64 works very slow (links Doom2DF few minutes on linux machine with Intel Core i7-5820K, while iBook G4 does the same in few seconds)
